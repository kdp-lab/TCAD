##### Purpose #####
# This is a miminal example to illustrate how to perform a Sentaurus TCAD simulation.  
# It contains a small script to generate a geometry called "BasicDiode.jrl"
# and a simulation command file to simulate the electric field at 500V. 
#####

##### How generate mesh #####
	1. Open the structure editor by typing "sde" in the terminal.
	2. Load the geometry journal file called "BasicDiode.jrl" by pressing File > Journal > Load
	3. Create a mesh by clicking Mesh > Build Mesh. Choose a name for the mesh and click "Build Mesh". 

##### How to start the simulation #####
	4. Open the file basicSimulation_des.cmd and put your filename in the follwing field: Grid = "FILENAME" 
	5. Save the file. 
	6. Start simulation by typing "sdevice basicSimulation_des.cmd" in the terminal. 

NOTE: A mesh create from BasicDiode.jrl already exists in the folder mesh. This means you can 
run "sdevice basicSimulation_des.cmd" out of the box. 

##### How to visualize the results ##### 
	7. Open Sentaurus Visual by typing svisual
	8. Load either "basicSimulation_des.plt" or "basicSimulation_des.tdr", which should
	   be produced by your simulation, to visualize the results. The .tdr file contains
	   the field maps at 500V while the .plt file contains graphs of various quantities 
	   as function of voltage between 0 and -500V.
