##### Purpose #####
# This is a minimal example to illustrate how to perform a Sentaurus TCAD simulation with radiation damage included. 
# It contains a mesh and a simulation command file to simulate the electric field at 500V and 1000V in addition to I-V curves. 
####### 

##### How to use ##### 
	1. Start simulation by typing "sdevice radDamage.cmd" in the terminal. 
	2. Open Sentaurus Visual by typing svisual
	3. Load either the .plt or _des.tdr, which should be produced by your simulation, to 
	   visualize the results. The .tdr files contains the field maps at 500V and 1000V 
	   while the .plt file contains graphs of various quantities  as function of voltage 
	   between 0 and 1000V.
